##VAT Calculator Example##

This project is a simple VAT calculator written in C#, using Cucumber and following a BDD approach.

**Impact Mapping**<br />
The project starts with Impact Mapping to ensure the goal of the project is clear. It defines the Goal, Actors, Impact and Deliverables.

**Example Mapping**<br />
With Impact Mapping complete and our scope of deliverables identified (Features), we now move onto creating the Examples of behaviour these features will deliver.

**Cucumber**<br />
The BDD tool used will be Cucumber as it is the most established tool for this use.

**Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition**<br />
To ensure we have free and/or open source tools we'll use VS2015 Community as our IDE.

**SpecFlow**<br />
The Cucumber version for .NET is SpecFlow and we'll install that into our project in VS2015 via the NuGet Package Manager.
There is a known issue where SpecFlow item templates are not loaded, we'll grab them via the VS Marketplace if needed.

**NUnit**<br />
We'll avoid the paid-for SpecFlow-Runner and use the well known NUnit. As above this will be installed into our project via the NuGet Package Manager.
